## Intro
Settled by Thomas Fowler in 1829, Maine became a hub the Through an analysis of the changing state of hydro-electric power in the of Millinocket, Maine.  

$f(x) = sin(x) + 12$

## Problem 1
$f(Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}) = KW_{T} = KW_{1} + KW_{2} + KW_{3}$

$g(Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}) = Q_{T} = Q_{1} + Q_{2} + Q_{3}$

$\Lambda\ \bigtriangledown\ g = 3$

$\Lambda\ + 3 = 2$

$\sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots}$

$k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}$
